# Unity3D-Gameplay-Demo

COMPLETED
--------------------------
Player movement (walk, jump)

Player facing direction logic

Basic third-person camera follow

Camera rotation with input

Initial refactor and code comments

Basic scene setup


Next (Short Term  Week 2)
-----------------------------------
Add simple test environment (walls, platforms)

Add basic player state (grounded / airborne)

Improve movement feel (acceleration, air control)

Optional: basic camera collision (raycast-based)


Gameplay Prototype Goals
--------------------------
Simple interactable object

One basic enemy or obstacle

Minimal gameplay loop (move -> avoid/interact -> reset)


Polish / Cleanup (Low Priority)
----------------------------------------
Further refactor movement & camera code

Improve variable naming consistency

Add simple materials for clarity

Scene organization (folders, naming)


Notes / Questions
------------------------
Decide CharacterController vs Rigidbody long-term

How much camera collision is “enough” for prototype

Balance speed vs control for player movement
